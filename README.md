# PACT
### Project Administration and Collaboration App

PACT is intended to reduce the complexity around project management and thereby maintaining the productivity.

1. A person can assign the members that he wants, to the different sections of project along with deadlines.
After completion of deadline of the project you would get a report stating who has completed the task within deadline.
2. The projects are composed in the form of boards.
3. Each board will have timeline activities(like do,doing done) in the form of list 
4. Each list will have multiple cards, which gives us information about progress of a particular module,people assigned,deadline and certain features related to it.
